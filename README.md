# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors.

This project was build with React as part of my Lighthouse Labs studies, having the client application communicate with an API server over HTTP, using Axios to make calls to the API, and I coudl also experience with different development environments, including Storybook, Jest, and Webpack Dev Server.
